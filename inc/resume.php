					I lived out of a tent in campgrounds throughout northwest Colorado, based out of Steamboat Springs. As a part of a 10 person crew I was cutting down standing dead trees killed by the mountain pine beetle and cutting them in to firewood lengths.

					During this time period I was able to get skilled with a chainsaw in a short period of time. It was a major mental victory to go from being slightly terrified of this implement of destruction to being totally comfortable with it in my hands. During this time I reveled in working with people that lived a very different life than me up to that point, and I learned a great deal about how to interact with people I donâ€™t agree with, especially when they are in the position of power.
