						During this time period I was able to get skilled with a chainsaw in a short period of time. It was a major mental victory to go from being slightly terrified of this implement of destruction to being totally comfortable with it in my hands. During this time I reveled in working with people that lived a very different life than me up to that point, and I learned a great deal about how to interact with people I don’t agree with, especially when they are in the position of power.

						Sometimes the lesson learned is a bitter pill to swallow. This was a rewarding job that reaffirmed my ability to work at a high skill level in stressful situations. But unfortunately this great experience was prematurely ended with a bitter lesson in how not to treat people. These lessons are best learned from up close, but better to be observed from a distance.
