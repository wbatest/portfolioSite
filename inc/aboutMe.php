				I was born and raised in the comforts of private school faculty housing in Connecticut. After graduating from St.Lawrence University as a Studio Art Major, I fulfilled my lifelong dream to live out west and ski. This journey has brought me to live in three wonderful Western states; Colorado, Utah and Oregon.

				I spent my winters working my way into the most responsible ski town job there is, ski patrol, and I spent my summers working with chainsaws. I worked as a wildland firefighter and I worked for a timber company. I greeted new experiences with the goal to always produce quality work, and a healthy dose of hidden terror.

			During this time I developed skills in areas I had never dreamed about. I got comfortable and capable in high risk situations. This taught me a great deal about myself, and it gave me an opportunity to learn a great deal about working with other people. Constantly changing jobs I learned how to recognize and categorize the abstract lessons I was being taught. During this time I learned a great deal about work ethic, quality of work, and communication.

			Two years ago it became my fianceâ€™s turn to move us to some where new, and flat. Minnesota's lack of mountains has given me the time to devlop old skills into new possibilities. I draw from my past experiences every day as I push myself into a new place of discomfort, working indoors full-time.
